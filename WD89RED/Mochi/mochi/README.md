======== MOCHI CLIENT APP =========

This is the client for the Mochi app.

Mochi is a kawaii-themed social media platform.

Mochi was developed for my web dev class at Eleven Fifty Academy as my final project.

Features user login and registration, a post feed, and a comment feed. Posts and comments can be deleted by both the user who created them and administrators. Post feed and comment feed load with newest posts at the top.

Built with React.

All dependencies are included in package.json.
